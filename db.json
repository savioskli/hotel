The returned static data for the accommodation codes is afterwards updated using the *Accommodation/Details* service and is cached locally.\r\n            \r\nPlease be aware that you should use the query parameter *ModifiedSince* to receive just the accommodation which have been updated in the following fields since your last import: *Prices*, *Accommodation/Details*. Interhome does not support any info of inactivated properties; so you need to create your own delta.\r\n## Caching\r\nYes\r\n## Timing/Duration of call\r\nWhole portfolio: 1 second\r\n            \r\nWith *ModifiedSince*: 3 seconds\r\n## Examples\r\n[https://ws.interhome.com/ih/b2b/V0100/accommodation/list](https://ws.interhome.com/ih/b2b/V0100/accommodation/list)",
